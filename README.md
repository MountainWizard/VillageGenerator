# Known Bugs
* Several text errors (they will never be fixed)
# Data
All Data is located in the daten.json file and sorted by Language. The Javascript will pick entries at random from the various lists.
# Translations
I am looking for Translators. The Village Generator is currently available in German and English because these are the only Languages i speak.
If you wish to Translate this Tool in other Languages like French or Spanish (or any other Language) please contact me or edit the JSON yourself.
The Items in the Arcane Shop and their descriptions are only available in English since i was too lazy to translate everything.
